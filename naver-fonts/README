The NanumGothicBold.ttf and NanumGothic.ttf fonts in this directory are
modified versions of the NanumGothicBold.ttf and NanumGothic.ttf fonts
from http://hangeul.naver.com/font.  Because these fonts ship with
DroidSansFallback.ttf (which contains an extensive collection of Chinese
glyphs as well as other non-Korean characters) and because these fonts
will ship on Android devices which do not use hints, the following changes
were made to reduce the size of the NanumGothicBold.ttf and NanumGothic.ttf
font files:

1. Remove 4,888 Chinese characters
2. Remove non-Korean characters other than ASCII (up to U+007F)
3. Remove hints
